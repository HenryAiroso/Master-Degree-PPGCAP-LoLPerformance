# Master-Degree-PPGCAP-LoLPerformance
Master’s dissertation project in Applied Computing analyzing League of Legends matches with machine learning. Uses Riot Games API (match-v5, account-v1, summoner-v4) to build datasets and models of player and team performance for non-commercial research. This repo represents a generic model for the problem, up to the full algorithm and it's specifications are under construction and in scientific research protection.

# League of Legends Performance AI – Master’s Dissertation

This repository contains the code and experiments for my master’s degree dissertation in Applied Computing.  
The project analyzes League of Legends matches using machine learning and deep learning to model team and player performance over time.

## Project Goals

- Collect historical ranked (and when allowed, competitive) match data using the Riot Games API.
- Build structured datasets with timelines (gold, XP, objectives, kills, etc.).
- Train and evaluate predictive models (e.g., win probability, game state classification).
- Produce aggregated, anonymized statistics for academic analysis and publications.

## Tech Stack

- Python (data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering)
- Jupyter Notebooks (experiments, models, visualizations)
- Riot Games API: `account-v1`, `summoner-v4`, `match-v5`
- Data Dragon / static LoL data for champions, items, runes

## Ethics and Data Use

- Non-commercial, academic-only use.
- Data analyzed in aggregate; individual players are not identified.
- No overlays, boosting, betting, or tools that provide unfair competitive advantage.
