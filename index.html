    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Master-Degree-PPGCAP-LoLPerformance</strong> is a
      non-commercial master’s dissertation project focused on
      <strong>League of Legends Performance AI</strong>. The research
      analyzes historical League of Legends matches using machine learning
      and deep learning to model team and player performance over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect historical ranked (and, when allowed, competitive) match data.</li>
      <li>Build structured timelines (gold, XP, objectives, kills, etc.).</li>
      <li>Train and evaluate predictive models (e.g., win probability, game state classification).</li>
      <li>Produce aggregated, anonymized statistics for academic analysis and publications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Riot Games API Usage</h3>
    <p>
      The project uses the official Riot Games API only for offline,
      research-oriented data collection:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>account-v1</code> / <code>summoner-v4</code> – resolve Riot IDs and PUUIDs to seed match collection.</li>
      <li><code>match-v5</code> – retrieve match details and timelines for feature engineering and model training.</li>
      <li>Data Dragon / static LoL data – champion, item and rune metadata.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python – data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering.</li>
      <li>Jupyter Notebooks – experiments, models, visualizations.</li>
      <li>Riot Games API – <code>account-v1</code>, <code>summoner-v4</code>, <code>match-v5</code>.</li>
      <li>Data Dragon / static LoL data – champions, items, runes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ethics and Data Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-commercial, academic-only use in a controlled research environment.</li>
      <li>Data is analyzed in aggregate; individual players are not identified or profiled.</li>
      <li>No overlays, scripts, bots, boosting, betting or tools that provide unfair competitive advantage.</li>
    </ul>
